### Hi there! ✨

I'm Nicole Castillo, and I am a Computer Science Student at the University of Sonora. I'm really interested in learning about machine learning and software engineering realated topics and tools.

When I'm not doing coding stuff, I pass the time by playing music, listening to podcasts, reading, and being super bad at video games.
