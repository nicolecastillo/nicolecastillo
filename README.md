### Hi there!
I'm Nicole Castillo, and I am a Computer Science Student at the University of Sonora.

I'm currently doing an internship at the Center for Research in Open Source Software where Iâ€™ve learned plenty of things and tools that are going to be useful for me in future projects, from machine learning and open-source concepts to soft skills such as teamwork and how to communicate my doubts.

When I'm not doing coding stuff, I pass the time by playing music, listening to podcasts, reading, and being super bad at video games. âœ¨
